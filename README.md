# Accelerating Deep Learning Image Classification with Intel oneAPI

## Introduction

Image classification is a significant task in the field of deep learning. However, deep learning models usually require substantial computational resources. To address this, this article introduces how to use Intel oneAPI tools, especially IntelÂ® AI Analytics Toolkit, to accelerate deep learning image classification tasks. We will build a simple Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and train it to classify images.

## Tools and Environment Setup

To complete this tutorial, you will need to install the following tools:

- [Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit](https://www.intel.cn/content/www/cn/zh/developer/tools/oneapi/toolkits.html)
- [Intel AI Analytics Toolkit](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/distribution-for-python.html)

You can install these tools via the links on the Intel official website.

## Data Preparation

We will use the CIFAR-10 dataset, which contains 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 10 classes.

You can use the following code to download and unzip the CIFAR-10 dataset:

```python
import torch
import torchvision
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5))
])

trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR10(root='./data', train=True,
                                        download=True, transform=transform)
```

## Building a Convolutional Neural Network Model

We will use PyTorch to build a simple Convolutional Neural Network model. This model will include two convolutional layers, one fully connected layer, and use ReLU as an activation function.

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 10)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x
```

## Accelerating Training with oneDNN

By using the Intel oneDNN library, we can accelerate the training of neural networks. We need to set environment variables to use oneDNN as PyTorch's backend.

```sh
export DNNL_VERBOSE=1
export TORCH_BACKEND=mkldnn
```

Then, we can start training our model.

```python
import torch.optim as optim

net = Net()

criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

for epoch in range(10):  
    for i, data in enumerate(trainloader, 0):
        inputs, labels = data
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = net(inputs)
        loss = criterion(outputs, labels)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

## Evaluating Model Performance

Finally, we can use the test set to evaluate our model

's performance. This will tell us how well the model performs on unseen data.

```python
correct = 0
total = 0
with torch.no_grad():
    for data in testloader:
        images, labels = data
        outputs = net(images)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

print('Accuracy of the network on the test images: %d %%' % (100 * correct / total))
```

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we used Intel oneAPI tools, especially the AI Analytics Toolkit, to accelerate a deep learning image classification task. We first built a Convolutional Neural Network model using PyTorch, then used oneDNN to accelerate the training process, and finally, we validated our model's performance on a test set. By using oneAPI, we can utilize hardware resources more effectively, accelerating the execution of deep learning tasks.
